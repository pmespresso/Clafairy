# Clafairy

## Was Ist Das?
Clafairy is a React/Electron desktop app for photographers and videographers who come back from a vacation with a ton of content that are named something along the lines of "picture20160601". These filenames are really useless when sorting and editing later so Clafairy uses Clarifai's image recognition services to automatically give meaningful names to these files like "cliff_outdoors_sunny_girl_picnic".

## How To Use

npm install
npm run watch build (this will create the bundle.js)
npm start
